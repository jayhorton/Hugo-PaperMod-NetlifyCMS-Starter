Granada, a city where Moorish history meets Spanish vibrancy, is most famous for the stunning Alhambra. This palace-fortress complex, with its intricate Islamic architecture and beautiful gardens, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  

In the Albaicín district, whitewashed houses and cobblestone streets lead to breathtaking viewpoints like Mirador de San Nicolás. At sunset, you can see the Alhambra glow against the Sierra Nevada mountains.  

Granada is also known for its **free tapas culture**—order a drink, and you’ll get a delicious snack for free. A perfect way to end the day in this enchanting city.
