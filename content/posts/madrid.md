## Madrid at the heart of Spain

Madrid, the heart of Spain, is a vibrant city full of history, culture, and life. From the stunning Royal Palace to the lively streets of Gran Vía, there's always something happening.  

One of the highlights is the Prado Museum, home to masterpieces by Goya, Velázquez, and El Greco. After a long day of sightseeing, locals and tourists alike gather at Plaza Mayor to enjoy tapas and a glass of sangria.  

For a breathtaking sunset view, head to the Temple of Debod, an ancient Egyptian temple relocated to Madrid.
