## The City of Three Cultures

Toledo, often called the “City of Three Cultures,” is a magnificent blend of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish heritage. The medieval streets wind through historic buildings, leading visitors to impressive landmarks like the Alcázar and the Cathedral of Toledo.  

## El Greco

One of the city's highlights is El Greco’s masterpiece, *The Burial of the Count of Orgaz*, housed in the Church of Santo Tomé. Don't forget to try *mazapán*, a local almond-based sweet that has been made here for centuries.  

For an unforgettable experience, visit Toledo at night when the city’s golden lights create an enchanting atmosphere.
